# Simulating Complex Dynamical Systems with PhiFlow
A collection of fluid dynamics, pattern formation, and geometry simulations built using PhiFlow. Includes:

Smoke Plume Variations – Simulating smoke plumes from different starting points.

Taylor–Green Vortex – A classical benchmark in fluid mechanics, used to study the decay of turbulence and test numerical solvers for the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations.

Mesh Construction – Generating and manipulating mesh geometries.

Julia Set – Visualizing complex fractals.

Reaction–Diffusion – A system where substances spread out in space (diffusion) while simultaneously interacting chemically (reaction), often producing complex patterns.

This repository serves as a sandbox for experimenting with numerical simulations, visualizations, and creative physics-based animations.
